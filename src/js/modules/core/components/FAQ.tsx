        <div className={classes.question}>
          <h2> Do I need prior experience?</h2>
          <p>
            Nope! HackNYU welcomes people of all skill levels. In fact, part of
            the fun of HackNYU is seeing beginners learn from hackathon
            veterans&mdash;and hopefully vice versa!
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className={classes.question}>
          <h2> Where is it?</h2>
          <p>
            HackNYU takes place on NYU campuses in New York, Abu Dhabi, and
            Shanghai. The New York event is hosted at the NYU Tandon School of
            Engineering, 6 MetroTech Center, Brooklyn, NY 11201, which is easily
            accessible via NYC's public transportation. Students enrolled in NYU
            Shanghai and NYU Abu Dhabi can participate in the event on their
            respective campuses.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className={classes.question}>
          <h2> Who can attend?</h2>
          <p>
            For our event in New York, anyone can attend! You don't have to be a
            part of the NYU community, and you don't have to be a student to
            participate. However, priority will be given to members of the NYU
            community and to students. If you are under 18, you will be required
            to bring a liability waiver signed by your parent or guardian during
            check-in. This form will be made available upon acceptance to our
            event. Attendees in Shanghai and Abu Dhabi must be enrolled at NYU.

        <div className={classes.question}>
          <h2> Will there be travel reimbursements? </h2>
          <p>
            Unfortunately, we are unable to provide travel reimbursements or
            send buses to nearby cities this year. We apologize for the
            inconvenience, and hope you can still make it!
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className={classes.question}>
          <h2> Will there be a place to shower? </h2>
          <p>
            Yep! We will have showers available during certain hours of the
            event. If you are planning to use them, make sure to bring your own
            towel and a change of clothes.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className={classes.question}>
          <h2> How will projects be judged?</h2>
          <p>
            Each of the four tracks will have their own judges and prizes.
            Judges will select three winning teams from each track. You can only
            submit your project to one track, so choose wisely!

        <div className={classes.question}>
          <h2> What should I bring? </h2>
          <p>
            Because the hackathon is overnight, we encourage bringing sleeping
            gear (sleeping bags, pillows, blankets, etc) and toiletries. There
            will be a designated sleeping area for participants to nap. We
            recommend bringing warm clothes, as the venue can get cold. Also
            make sure to bring your laptop and charger, as well as any other
            gear you plan on using. Lastly, if you are under 18, please bring
            your liability form! The form will be sent out after acceptance.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div className={classes.question}>
          <h2> What about teams? </h2>
          <p>
            Teams are limited to 4 people. You do NOT have to come with a team
            to the hackathon. There will be a place where hackers can form teams
            and brainstorm ideas.
